# Classification-Using-Binary-Matrix-Approach

This is a novel classification algorithm using binary matrix approach.

Requirements to use the algorithm&#39;s main code:

1. Download the Numpy, Pandas and Easygui libraries.
2. Adjust the directories in code before you run it.
3. For usage of default data-set, download the diabetes data-set from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/diabetes/](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/diabetes/)

Parameters that you can adjust are given as default in the code itself.
